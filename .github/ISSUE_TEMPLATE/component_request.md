**What is the use case for the component you're requesting?**
Describe the behavioral pattern and content pattern(s) that would be covered by this component. If there are existing instances of these patterns, provide links to them to help assess the breadth of coverage needed.

**Landscape analysis**
Provide links to pages or design systems that provide an example of this component. They don't need to be the exact solution, but can help identify things we want to draw from or explicitly avoid.

**Additional considerations**
Note any accessibility, usability, or semantic markup nuances to consider when designing and building the component.
