<PageSection title="1. Use simple words">
  <p>Short, simple words are preferable to fancy ones.</p>
  <BestPractices
    Do="Use the new Publishers dashboard to monitor downloads."
    Dont="You can now utilize the new Publishers dashboard to monitor download activity."
  />
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="2. Main point first">
  <p>
    When you are describing a goal and the action needed to achieve it, start the sentence with the
    goal.
  </p>
  <BestPractices
    Do="To save the item to your Workspace, log in to your account"
    Dont="Log in to your account to save the item to your Workspace"
  />
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="3. Be concise">
  <p>It's worth saying again: The way we write is simple and direct.</p>
  <BestPractices Do="Save changes?" Dont="Would you like to save your changes?" />
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="4. Be positive">
  <p>Emphasize the action a user can take, not the action they can't.</p>
  <BestPractices
    Do="To sign in, you must be an authorized user."
    Dont="You're not authorized to view this page."
  />
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="5. Avoid jargon, idioms, and slang">
  <p>
    Communications need to be understood by users the world over. Even the most common expressions
    in the US aren't always understandable in other countries. "Catch you later" for "goodbye" or
    "no problem" instead of "you're welcome" can lead to confusion. Jargon and internal terminology
    are also to be avoided.
  </p>
  <BestPractices Do="Video is loading" Dont="Buffering…" />
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="6. Be consistent">
  <p>
    Use the same wording to refer to the same items and actions; don't talk about the archive in one
    paragraph and switch to database in the next.
  </p>
  <BestPractices
    Do="To sign in, you must be an authorized user."
    Dont="You're not authorized to view this page."
  />
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="7. Stay active">
  <p>
    Avoid passive voice. Use active verbs and direct forms of speech whenever possible. It's clearer
    and sounds more personal. Things aren't done, we do things. It's clearer, and it sounds better.
  </p>
  <BestPractices
    Do="We are extending expanded access through December 31."
    Dont="Expanded access has been extended through December 31."
  />
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="8. Avoid negative constructions">
  <BestPractices
    Do="Sign up to access the content."
    Dont="You cannot access the content without signing up."
  />
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="9. Use contractions">
  <p>Contractions sound more conversational.</p>
  <BestPractices
    Do="Don't hesitate to reach out."
    Dont="Do not hesitate to get in touch with us."
  />
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="10. Read it aloud">
  <p>
    If it doesn't sound right, it doesn't read right either. It's also a good way to catch typos and
    errors.
  </p>
