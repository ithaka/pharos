# Getting Started

<br />

## Installation

Install the Pharos design system using one of the following commands:

```

# yarn
yarn add @ithaka/pharos

# npm
npm install @ithaka/pharos
```

<br />

Once installed, the `node_modules/` directory should contain directories similar to following structure:

```

@ithaka/pharos/lib
├── assets/
│   ├── fonts            // Font files used for Pharos
│   ├── icons            // Pharos icons (used with the icon component)
├── components/          // Folder containing Vue.js/Vanilla components
├── react-components/    // Folder containing React components
├── styles/
│   ├── _variables.css   // Commonly used tokens for styling
│   ├── fonts.css        // CSS to have fonts available to use
│   ├── typography.scss  // CSS styles to apply fonts and styles to root elements
└── ...
```

<br />
<br />

## Using Pharos components

Pharos uses <PharosLink href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">Web Components</PharosLink> to remain compatible with React and Vue.
To accomodate patterns of each framework, the implementations vary slightly. The usage of the components are similar
to any other library used: import the desired component, use the base component, and add in the desired props.

> Note: There is a slight variation in the import paths. <br />
> Developers using Pharos in React should import from `@ithaka/pharos/lib/react-components/` <br />
> Otherwise, imports are from `@ithaka/pharos/lib/components/`

To demonstrate the usage in both Vue and React, you'll next see how to use the base Pharos Button component.

<br />

### Pharos + React

The following code shows how to use Pharos's button component with **React** to produce a basic button, as seen below the code

```jsx
import { PharosButton } from "@ithaka/pharos/lib/react-components/button/pharos-button";
  ...

<PharosButton>
  React button
</PharosButton>
```

<PharosButton>React button</PharosButton>

<br />
<br />
<br />

### Pharos + Vue

Similarly, the following code shows how to use Pharos's button component with **Vue** to produce a basic button, as seen below the code

```

<script>
  import "@ithaka/pharos/lib/components/button/pharos-button";
  ...
</script>

<template>
  ...
  <pharos-button>
    Vue button
  </pharos-button>
</template>
```

<pharos-button>Vue Button</pharos-button>

<br />
<br />

### Props + Storybook

The props for each component control various parts of the component, from style to function. Learning which props are available for
each component, along with how they interact with the component, is crucial in using the Pharos design system. Pharos components
are fully documented to allow IDEs to take advantage of intellisense features, which in turn allows you to browse through
props.

For a more interactive approach to understand props, Pharos provides a <PharosLink href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</PharosLink>.
Our Storybook stories demonstrates the usage of props for each component, while providing the code used in the demonstration. Many components'
stories allow you adjust the values of different props to preview and understand the impact of those props.

## Style with Pharos

### Using the Recommended Fonts

As part of the package, Pharos includes a few curated fonts that are integrated into components. To allow consistency between
components and other elements, you should use these fonts for other parts of the site. If you want to read more
about Pharos' typography, including guidelines for font usage scenarios, head over to the <PharosLink href="http://localhost:8000/brand-expressions/typography">typography</PharosLink> page.

To use the correct fonts, start by importing them by importing `@ithaka/pharos/lib/styles/fonts.css` at the top level of your web app.
Once imported, set the root body font and styles by importing `@ithaka/pharos/lib/styles/typography.scss`. If there are places
where the body font is being overwritten, apply the font wherever the style is being overwritten by setting the `font-family` property to include either
`GT America Standard` (generally for body) or `Ivar Headline` (generally for headers).

The following examples use inline styling, but the same principles remain for other methods of styling.

#### Pharos fonts with Vue

```
<script>
  ...
  import "@ithaka/pharos/lib/styles/fonts.css";
  import "@ithaka/pharos/lib/styles/typography.scss";
  ...
</script>

<template>
  ...
  <div class="text">
    This is an example of text with Pharos fonts.
  </div>
  ...
</template>

<style lang="scss">
  ...
  .text {
    font-family: GT America Standard;
  }
  ...
</style>
```

<br />

#### Pharos fonts with React

```
import "@ithaka/pharos/lib/styles/fonts.css";
import "@ithaka/pharos/lib/styles/typography.scss";

const styleObject = {
  fontFamily: "GT America Standard"
}

...  //in render method
<div style={styleObject}>
  This is an example of text with Pharos fonts.
</div>
...
```

<br />
<br />

### Pharos Design Tokens

Pharos components use design tokens to keep values consistent for all facets of design, including spacing, size, and colors.
These design tokens are also provided to developers using Pharos in order to provide assistance in creating a consistent look and feel in pages
where both Pharos components and other elements exist.

To start using the design tokens, import the `@ithaka/pharos/lib/styles/_variables.scss` file and use the desired token in the styles for
your web app. You can inspect the imported file to see all the tokens and their corresponding values.
