  title="Importance"
  description="Documentation is essential to upholding quality and cohesion. 
Articulate and thorough documentation allows for users and contributors to acquire knowledge more efficiently, motivating further contribution and information sharing. 
Referring to documentation helps to reduce redundancy in components and features while ensuring all implemented features are being used appropriately and to their 
fullest potential."

<PageSection
  title="When documentation is needed"
  description="When a new component or feature is added, supporting documentation should be written to communicate and provide guidelines for its proper usage. 
Additionally, if changes are made to existing components that affect their usage or functionality, the documentation should reflect these changes."
