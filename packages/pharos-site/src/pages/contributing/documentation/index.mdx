  description="Documentation is essential to upholding quality and cohesion. 
  Articulate and thorough documentation allows for users and contributors to acquire knowledge more efficiently, motivating further contribution and information sharing.

  fullest potential."

<PageSection
  title="When documentation is needed"
  description="When a new component or feature is added, supporting documentation should be written to communicate and provide guidelines for its proper usage. 
  Additionally, if changes are made to existing components that affect their usage or functionality, the documentation should reflect these changes."
