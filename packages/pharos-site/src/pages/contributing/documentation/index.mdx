  title="Importance"
  description="Documentation is essential to upholding quality and cohesion.
  Articulate and thorough documentation allows for users and contributors to acquire knowledge more efficiently, motivating further contribution and information sharing.
  Referring to documentation helps to reduce redundancy in components and features while ensuring all implemented features are being used appropriately and to their
  fullest potential."

<PageSection
  title="When documentation is needed"
  description="When a new component or feature is added, supporting documentation should be written to communicate and provide guidelines for its proper usage.
  Additionally, if changes are made to existing components that affect their usage or functionality, the documentation should reflect these changes."

    <p>
      Please refer to the{' '}
      <PharosLink href="/content-style-guide/voice-and-tone">JSTOR content style guide</PharosLink>{' '}

      Concise
    </PharosHeading>
    <p>
      The way we write is simple and direct, and for all reading levels. It should be understandable
      by anyone regardless of their culture, language, or ability. We aim to provide the right
      amount of context so our users know how to use Pharos components or elements successfully.
    </p>
    <PharosHeading level={'4'} preset={'2'}>
      Consistent
    </PharosHeading>
    <p>
      We use the same template for each of the components to create predictability in understanding
      their purpose, standards, and variations. We also aim to use consistent language in all
      documentation so users experience a seamless transition as they make their way through the
      site.
    </p>
    <PharosHeading level={'4'} preset={'2'}>
      Style
    </PharosHeading>
    <p>
      Wherever possible, write headings and titles in sentence case — studies indicate that sentence
      case is easier to read, plus title case can come across as heavy and overly serious.

      Code expectations
