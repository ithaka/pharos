    Articulate and thorough documentation allows for users and contributors to acquire knowledge more efficiently, motivating further contribution and information sharing.

    fullest potential."

    Additionally, if changes are made to existing components that affect their usage or functionality, the documentation should reflect these changes."

            Concise
          </PharosHeading>
          <p>
            The way we write is simple and direct, and for all reading levels. It should be
            understandable by anyone regardless of their culture, language, or ability. We aim to
            provide the right amount of context so our users know how to use Pharos components or
            elements successfully.

            Consistent
          </PharosHeading>
          <p>
            We use the same template for each of the components to create predictability in
            understanding their purpose, standards, and variations. We also aim to use consistent
            language in all documentation so users experience a seamless transition as they make
            their way through the site.

            Style
          </PharosHeading>
          <p>
            Wherever possible, write headings and titles in sentence case â€” studies indicate that
            sentence case is easier to read, plus title case can come across as heavy and overly
            serious.
