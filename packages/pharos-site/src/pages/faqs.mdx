<PageSection title="How can Pharos help my development?" subSectionLevel={2}>
  <p>
    Pharos contains visual and behavioral components that are consistent with our design decisions
    out of the box.
  </p>
</PageSection>

<PageSection
  title="I tried adopting a component but encountered a number of issues. How do I know when something is usable?"
  subSectionLevel={2}
>
  <p>
    You can find the status of each component on the{' '}
    <PharosLink href="https://pharos.jstor.org/components/component-status">component status page</PharosLink>. This
    page will reflect the progress on various aspects of a component's readiness and help you
    understand what to expect before adopting a component so you can plan accordingly.
  </p>
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="What do I do if I still run into issues?" subSectionLevel={2}>
  <p>
    Give us the gift of feedback! When you run into issues it's important that you be vocal about
    it and not let that inhibit or discourage you from adopting them. We need your help to identify
    the gaps and sincerely welcome feedback no matter how tough it is.
  </p>
  <p>
    The recommended way to provide feedback is via Github issues. Creating an issue in the
    repository will provide a common place to track and discuss the nature of the issue, as well as
    potential solutions.
  </p>

<PageSection
  title="What are the risks of adopting components late or infrequently? How will we manage this?"
  subSectionLevel={2}
>
  <p>
    Design systems help bring consistency to platforms, so falling behind may result in duplication
    of effort in replicating styles and behaviors. It may also result in more catch up. Finally, if
    you're on an unsupported version of Pharos you may not benefit from the latest bug and security
    fixes.
  </p>
  <p>
    We'll be managing this by developing a support policy, using semantic versioning, and
    communicating changes through change logs and discussions.

<PageSection
  title="I expected Pharos components to make my page more performant, but they made my bundle bigger. Why is that happening?"
  subSectionLevel={2}
>
  <p>
    The Pharos core package delivers components that are{' '}
    <PharosLink href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/">tree shakable</PharosLink>, so
    that you can be sure you only end up with the code you need. To benefit from tree shaking,
    though, you may need to update your build process to match it.

<PageSection
  title="I don't know enough about components before trying to use them. How can I find out more?"
  subSectionLevel={2}
>
  <p>
    We're continuously working on the documentation—for both{' '}
    <PharosLink href="https://pharos.jstor.org/storybook/?path=/story/pharos-10-1-0-intro--page">
      development
    </PharosLink>{' '}
    and <PharosLink href="https://pharos.jstor.org">design</PharosLink>—to make sure it's accurate
    and thorough. If you find that a component is documented properly or thoroughly, please
    communicate how it can be improved.
