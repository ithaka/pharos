            JSTOR is a partner to libraries, museums, and publishers. We work hard to reduce costs
            and extend access to underserved populations. The way we communicate with the world is a
            reflection of these efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The essence of our mission at JSTOR comes through in all our interactions consistently,
            whether we're emailing librarians about our services, helping a user who lost their
            password, or presenting images in their search results. By being consistent, we provide
            our users with a seamless experience and build their trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            This guide will help you keep a consistent voice and style when writing for JSTOR to
            maintain this trust.

          The JSTOR voice is clear, trustworthy, and authentic. Copy is conversational, answers
          users' questions, and guides them through tasks. This conversation is the core of UX
          writing, and it runs through the entire user experience.
        </p>

            Clear
          </PharosHeading>
          <p>
            People use JSTOR for their research; our efforts to communicate should make this as easy
            as possible, which is why clarity is the most important aspect in our writing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Writing is conversational and at times delightful, but doesn't get in the way of telling
            the user what's going on. There is room for personality in our one-on-one interactions,
            but always keep in mind that our communications need to be understood by users the world
            over.

          </PharosHeading>
          <p>
            We are a resource for research and knowledge. Good writing and proper grammar reinforces
            our users' trust in our reliability. Keeping this trust is also why we never make any
            claims without backing them up.
          </p>

        <PharosHeading level={3} preset="4">
          Authentic
        </PharosHeading>
        <p>
          We sound like who we are: real people talking about real things. We write like we speak—no
          salesy language or robotic instructions. As genuine partners of the academic and research
          communities, we write authentically.

            While we maintain the same voice through all our communications — clear, trustworthy,
            and authentic — different touch points and scenarios along the user's journey call for
            different tones.

            The four dimensions of tone
          </PharosHeading>
          <p>
            As outlined by UX researchers at the Nielsen Norman Group, there are four main
            dimensions of tone: funny/serious, formal/casual, respectful/irreverent, and
            enthusiastic/matter-of-fact. While generally JSTOR will lean towards being serious,
            casual, respectful, and matter of fact, we adjust these dimensions according to the
            context of our message, both in what we're trying to communicate and the channels in
            which we are communicating.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div style={{ marginBottom: 'var(--pharos-spacing-2-x)' }}>
          <PharosHeading level={'4'} preset={'2'}>
            Serious over funny
          </PharosHeading>
          <p>
            Our users are on JSTOR primarily to do research — they may be writing a paper, studying
            for an exam, or preparing a course, so they want information, not jokes. Occasionally,
            there may be opportunities for humor, but tread with care. Ask yourself: will a
            stressed-out university student having difficulties logging in really find this amusing?
          </p>
        </div>
        <div style={{ marginBottom: 'var(--pharos-spacing-2-x)' }}>
          <PharosHeading level={'4'} preset={'2'}>
            Casual over formal
          </PharosHeading>
          <p>
            While academic content is often formal, we want JSTOR itself to be accessible and
            personal, so we take a casual tone as a reminder that there are real people behind the
            platform and the organization.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div style={{ marginBottom: 'var(--pharos-spacing-2-x)' }}>
          <PharosHeading level={'4'} preset={'2'}>
            Respectful over irreverent
          </PharosHeading>
          <p>
            Not unlike serious vs. funny, to earn our users' trust, our tone is always respectful.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <PharosHeading level={'4'} preset={'2'}>
            Matter-of-fact over enthusiastic
          </PharosHeading>
          <p>
            As part of our authenticity, we use a matter-of-fact tone — no hyperbole, no fuss, no
            hard sell. You could say we keep things cool. These are all subjective qualities, of
            course. Just remember, as we do in personal conversations, we adapt our tone depending
            on who we're communicating with and what we're saying to them. Not sure if you're
            getting it quite right? Try saying it out loud.

          Our job, always, is to help. Keep the user in mind and the particular needs we're

        <p>
          The way we write is simple and direct, and for all reading levels. It should be
