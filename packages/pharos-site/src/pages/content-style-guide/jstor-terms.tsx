        <PageSection title="ITHAKA" subSectionLevel={1} lessMargin>
          <p>
            ITHAKA should always be spelled in all capital letters. ITHAKA is described as an
            "organization," not a company. We are a not-for-profit (believe it or not, there is a
            legal difference between a nonprofit and a not-for-profit).
          </p>

        <PageSection title="JSTOR" subSectionLevel={1} lessMargin>
          <p>
            Use "library," "platform," or simply "JSTOR" as a proper noun. JSTOR is a digital
            library; a research and teaching platform; a not-for-profit service.
          </p>
          <p>As with a website, you find elements "on" JSTOR. Not "at" or "in."</p>
          <p>
            Don't use jstor.org when you mean JSTOR the service, only use it when you are pointing
            to the page, and always spell the URL in lowercase.
          </p>
        </PageSection>
        <PageSection title="JSTOR Forum" subSectionLevel={1} lessMargin>
          <p>
            Always call it JSTOR Forum on the first mention; you may just call it Forum after that.
          </p>
        </PageSection>
        <PageSection title="Artstor" subSectionLevel={1} lessMargin>
          <p>
            As we prepare for the integration of Artstor into the JSTOR platform, we are no longer
            referring to the Artstor Digital Library (ADL); it is now simply Artstor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some categories of Artstor include Artstor Public Collections (capitalized since it's a
            proper name), which are freely available collections contributed by institutions using
            JSTOR Forum, and Open Artstor, Creative Commons-licensed collections aggregated from
            museums, libraries and archives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Artstor Image Workspace (AIW) is an internal way to refer to the platform (in
            distinction to the collections); don't use this term externally.

          <p>
            Free online reading enables any user with a JSTOR account to read a number of articles
            free each month. This access program is often referred to internally as register &amp;
            read.

            JPASS offers monthly or annual access to 2,000+ journals on JSTOR and the Struggles for
            Freedom: Southern Africa primary sources collection. When referring to the JPASS
            program, say "JPASS" or "JPASS plans." When referencing an individual's JPASS
            subscription, refer to it as their "JPASS plan."

          <p>
            Independent researchers can purchase lifetime access to individual articles and issues
            through Publisher Sales Service (PSS). PSS is most frequently used internally.

        <p>
          JSTOR offers the following ebook acquisition models: Demand-Driven Acquisition (DDA),
          Evidence-Based Acquisition (EBA), and individual title acquisition (sometimes referred
          internally as Pick 'n' Mix). Our DDA payment models are deposit and pay-as-you-go.

        <p>
          Do not abbreviate as "Books @ JSTOR" or "B@J. Use the word "books" when talking about
          high-level descriptions of Books at JSTOR. Use "ebooks" on descriptions and more granular
          explanations.

            the e.

        <PageSection title="Collections" subSectionLevel={1}>
          <p>
            Capitalize "collection" when it is used in the title of a collection (e.g., "the Arts
            &amp; Sciences I Collection"), but not when it is used more generally to refer to groups
            of titles (e.g., "archival journal collections on JSTOR"). For all Arts &amp; Sciences
            collections, an ampersand (&amp;) should always be usedâ€”never the word "and."
          </p>
          <p>
            We refer to Open Community Collections as an initiative, and it's composed of
            collections that are made freely available to everyone. The institutions that provide
            the content are referred to as contributors.

          <p>
            Avoid using the possessive in relation to content on JSTOR. JSTOR does not publish its
            own content, but rather provides a platform for it.
