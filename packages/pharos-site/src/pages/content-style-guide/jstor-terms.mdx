  <PageSection title="ITHAKA" subSectionLevel={1} lessMargin>
    <p>
      ITHAKA should always be spelled in all capital letters. ITHAKA is described as an
      "organization," not a company. We are a not-for-profit (believe it or not, there is a legal
      difference between a nonprofit and a not-for-profit).
    </p>
  </PageSection>
  <PageSection title="JSTOR" subSectionLevel={1} lessMargin>
    <p>
      Use "library," "platform," or simply "JSTOR" as a proper noun. JSTOR is a digital library; a
      research and teaching platform; a not-for-profit service.
    </p>
    <p>As with a website, you find elements "on" JSTOR. Not "at" or "in."</p>
    <p>
      Don't use jstor.org when you mean JSTOR the service, only use it when you are pointing to the
      page, and always spell the URL in lowercase.
    </p>
  </PageSection>
  <PageSection title="JSTOR Forum" subSectionLevel={1} lessMargin>
    <p>Always call it JSTOR Forum on the first mention; you may just call it Forum after that.</p>
  </PageSection>
  <PageSection title="Artstor" subSectionLevel={1} lessMargin>
    <p>
      As we prepare for the integration of Artstor into the JSTOR platform, we are no longer
      referring to the Artstor Digital Library (ADL); it is now simply Artstor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some categories of Artstor include Artstor Public Collections (capitalized since it's a proper
      name), which are freely available collections contributed by institutions using JSTOR Forum,
      and Open Artstor, Creative Commons-licensed collections aggregated from museums, libraries and
      archives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Artstor Image Workspace (AIW) is an internal way to refer to the platform (in distinction to
      the collections); don't use this term externally.

<PageSection title="Individual access programs">
  <p style={{ marginBottom: 'var(--pharos-spacing-3-x)' }}>
    We offer a few different individual access programs for independent researchers.
  </p>
  <PageSection title="Free online reading" subSectionLevel={1}>
    <p>
      Free online reading enables any user with a JSTOR account to read a number of articles free
      each month. This access program is often referred to internally as register &amp; read.
    </p>

  <PageSection title="JPASS" subSectionLevel={1}>
    <p>
      JPASS offers monthly or annual access to 2,000+ journals on JSTOR and the Struggles for
      Freedom: Southern Africa primary sources collection. When referring to the JPASS program, say
      "JPASS" or "JPASS plans." When referencing an individual's JPASS subscription, refer to it as
      their "JPASS plan."
    </p>
    <BestPractices
      Do="We offer an auto-renew option for the JPASS monthly plan."
      Dont="Buy your JPASS now!"

  </PageSection>
  <PageSection title="PSS" subSectionLevel={1}>
    <p>
      Independent researchers can purchase lifetime access to individual articles and issues through
      Publisher Sales Service (PSS). PSS is most frequently used internally.

    <BestPractices Do="Purchase article" Dont="Buy this article through PSS." />

<PageSection title="Books at JSTOR">
  <p>
    JSTOR offers the following ebook acquisition models: Demand-Driven Acquisition (DDA),
    Evidence-Based Acquisition (EBA), and individual title acquisition (sometimes referred
    internally as Pick 'n' Mix). Our DDA payment models are deposit and pay-as-you-go.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do not abbreviate as "Books @ JSTOR" or "B@J. Use the word "books" when talking about high-level
    descriptions of Books at JSTOR. Use "ebooks" on descriptions and more granular explanations.
  </p>
  <BestPractices

  <PageSection title="Ebook" subSectionLevel={1}>
    <p>
      We use the compound word ebook (except when talking about Books at JSTOR at a higher level).
      When using at the beginning of a sentence and in title case headings, capitalize the e.

<PageSection title="Other terms" moreTitleSpace>
  <PageSection title="Collections" subSectionLevel={1}>
    <p>
      Capitalize "collection" when it is used in the title of a collection (e.g., "the Arts &amp;
      Sciences I Collection"), but not when it is used more generally to refer to groups of titles
      (e.g., "archival journal collections on JSTOR"). For all Arts &amp; Sciences collections, an
      ampersand (&amp;) should always be used—never the word "and."
    </p>
    <p>
      We refer to Open Community Collections as an initiative, and it's composed of collections that
      are made freely available to everyone. The institutions that provide the content are referred
      to as contributors.
    </p>
  </PageSection>
  <PageSection title="Content on JSTOR" subSectionLevel={1}>
    <p>
      Avoid using the possessive in relation to content on JSTOR. JSTOR does not publish its own
      content, but rather provides a platform for it.

      We refer to our "Partner and User Services" team as "JSTOR Support" externally. If you are
      directing users to get in touch with our support team, say contact JSTOR Support and link the
      full phrase.

  <PageSection title="Participant" subSectionLevel={1}>
    <p>
      Institutions that provide access to content on JSTOR are called "participants," not customers,
      clients, etc.
    </p>
    <p>Use "participant" and its variants when referring to an institution.</p>
    <BestPractices
      Do="Participants include small institutions, large universities, and secondary schools."
      Dont="Our clients are anyone from high schools to large institutions."
