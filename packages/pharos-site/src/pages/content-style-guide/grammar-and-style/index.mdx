<PageSection title="Actions" subSectionLevel={1}>
  <div>
    <p>These are the actions that people take as they use our sites:</p>
    <ul>
      {[
        'They "visit" or "go to" a webpage',
        'They "open" a drop-down menu.',
        'They "select" a subpage, tab, or dropdown menu item.',
        'They "select" a button or link.',
      ].map((string, index) => (
        <li key={index} style={{ listStyle: 'none' }}>
          {string}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
    <p>
      Try device-agnostic words that describe the action, irrespective of the interface. When in
      doubt, use "select." Don't use "navigate" or "navigate to."
    </p>
  </div>
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="Acronyms" subSectionLevel={1}>
  <p>
    If there's a chance your reader won't recognize an abbreviation or acronym, spell it out the
    first time you mention it and follow with the acronym in parenthesis. After that, you can just
    use the acronym.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      {['First: Single Sign-On (SSO)', 'Second: SSO'].map((string, index) => (
        <li key={index} style={{ listStyle: 'none' }}>
          {string}
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If the acronym is only used once in the copy, consider skipping it altogether and just use the
    full term.
  </p>
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="Ampersands" subSectionLevel={1}>
  <p>
    Don't use ampersands unless they're part of an official title (e.g. Register &amp; Read or
    Language &amp; Literature). Instead use "and."
  </p>
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="Commas" subSectionLevel={1}>
  <p>
    Use a comma before a conjunction (e.g. "and," "or," and "but") when it joins two independent
    clauses.
  </p>
  <BestPractices

    Dont="We believe education is key to the well-being of individuals, and society."
  />
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="Dates" subSectionLevel={1}>
  <p>
    When specific dates are expressed, cardinal numbers are used (e.g., November 5). Do not write
    "November 5th." Wherever possible, spell out the full month or shorten it to three characters
    (i.e. Nov 5). Where appropriate, represent dates or date ranges numerically as YYYY-MM-DD to
    align with the COUNTER 5 standard (i.e. in reporting and tables).
  </p>
  <BestPractices
    Do="Join us on November 19 for the final session."
    Dont="Sign up for a webinar on 5/11/2020."
  />
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="Email addresses" subSectionLevel={1}>
  <p>
    When referencing contact information, ask for an email address. An "email" is the correspondence
    sent to that address.
  </p>
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="Exclamation marks" subSectionLevel={1}>
  <p>
    Use exclamation points sparingly and only for positive messages; never use exclamation marks in
    feature announcements, error messages, or alerts. Also, don't use them more than once in a
    message, and never more than one exclamation mark at a time.
  </p>
  <BestPractices Do="Thanks for your participation!" Dont="Your username/password are wrong!!" />
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="Ellipses (...)" subSectionLevel={1}>
  <p>
    There are two main uses for ellipses in the product: to show that an action is in progress (e.g.
    "Loading…" "Connecting…" "Uploading…"), and to shorten words when the text gets too long (a.k.a.
    truncation).
  </p>
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="Home page" subSectionLevel={1}>
  <p>Two words. Not "homepage."</p>
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="Login, log in, log in to" subSectionLevel={1}>
  <p>
    "Log in" is the verb and "login" is the noun. That is, use "log in" when describing the action,
    "login" when describing an account. Also: you "log in to" your JSTOR account, not "log into."
  </p>
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="Numbers" subSectionLevel={1}>
  <p>
    The numbers zero through nine should be spelled out. Use numerals for all higher numbers unless
    the number is the first word in the sentence. In numbers of more than three digits, use a comma
    after every third digit from right to left (e.g. 1,537,000).
  </p>
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="Content on JSTOR" subSectionLevel={1}>
  <p>
    Both when quoting something and when using quotation marks for other reasons (such as an article
    title), punctuation goes within the quotation marks.
  </p>

<PageSection title="Single space after periods" subSectionLevel={1}>
  <p>
    Double spacing after periods is a leftover from writing on typewriters, and it's no longer
    necessary.
  </p>
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="Time" subSectionLevel={1}>
  <p>
    We are communicating with users around the world, so always indicate the time zone we're
    referring to (usually ET or EST, but it depends on the area we are targeting). Use uppercase
    "AM" and "PM" with one space after the numerical time.
