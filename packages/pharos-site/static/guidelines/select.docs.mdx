  A select allows users to choose one option from a list in a form.

## Best Practices

Select is a type of input that is used in forms, where a user is submitting data and chooses one option from a list.

### Do's

- Use when you have 6 or more pre-defined mutually exclusive options for the user to choose from (use the select component instead of radio buttons)
- Have a default selection when possible
- Use "Select" as the default placeholder option if there's no logical default option
- Labels should be concise

### Dont's

- Avoid using a select for navigational related needs, a dropdown menu will suffice
- Avoid long-winded labels for the options, 1-3 words

## Content Guidelines

### Labels

- Succinctly write labels, they are no more than 3 words
- Write in sentence case
- Avoid punctuation and articles ("the," "a," "an")

### Select Options

- Start with "Select" as a placeholder if there isn't a default option
- Relates to what the option will ultimately do
- List options alphabetically or in a logical order (like frequency of use)
- Written in sentence case
- Avoid punctuation and articles ("the," "a," "an")
