    <div style={{ marginBottom: 'var(--pharos-spacing-3-x)' }}>
      <p>
        Modals are used to present critical information or request user input needed to complete a
        task. Modals are meant to purposely interrupt a user's workflow and should be used sparingly
        to limit disruption to the user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modals are used for quick tasks that put a user into a specific "mode," like editing,
        deleting, and citing, or displaying specific, focused information like a data table.

    <div style={{ marginBottom: 'var(--pharos-spacing-3-x)' }}>
      <ul>
        <li>When a user needs to do a focused task (e.g., enter specific information)</li>
        <li>
          When a user needs to go through a workflow with multiple steps (e.g., "Create a report")
        </li>
        <li>To confirm a user wants to take an action (e.g., deleting information)</li>
        <li>To display pertinent, quick information</li>
        <li>To display promotional or product marketing (e.g., "Welcome to workspace")</li>

<PageSection title="Content Guidelines">
  <PageSection title="Modal Heading" isSubsection lessMargin>
    A modal's heading should be concise, describing the information or action being presented. They
    should be written in sentence case and describe the action a user will take (e.g., "Delete
    folder," "Create report," or "Cite") or relevant information to the copy being displayed.
    Punctuation is generally not needed or encouraged in modal headings.
  </PageSection>
  <PageSection title="Modal Content" isSubsection lessMargin>
    There are no specific requirements for the content of a modal; it can be composed as the
    information calls for. The content could include supporting body copy or form elements.
  </PageSection>
  <PageSection title="Modal Footer" isSubsection lessMargin>
    The footer content contains all possible actions for the user to take, but can also include
    further pertinent/relevant information. For buttons, use descriptive words such as "Add," and
    Save.
  </PageSection>
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="States">
  <PageSection title="No Footer" isSubsection lessMargin>
    Use for information-only based content that does not require the user to take an action.
  </PageSection>
  <PageSection title="Mobile" isSubsection lessMargin>
    For screen sizes smaller than our Tablet (768px) down to our Mobile size (320px), the modal will
    act as a "sheet" and take over the entire width and height of the screen.
  </PageSection>
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="Variants">
  <PageSection title="Small" isSubsection lessMargin>
    Use for quick, short information. The small modal size should also be used to confirm delete
    actions.
  </PageSection>
  <PageSection title="Medium (Default)" isSubsection lessMargin>
    Medium is our default modal size. It can be used in most instances.
  </PageSection>
  <PageSection title="Large" isSubsection lessMargin>
    For displaying more complex information, such as data tables, use the large modal for maximum
    screen real-estate.

  <PageSection title="Importance" isSubsection lessMargin>
    Modals should not open automatically as this can interrupt a users workflow. By giving the user
    control when they would like to view this modal, this gives them the freedom to decide when they
    would like to be given the additional information in the overlay.

    :<ul>
      <li>
        When the modal is open, only interactable elements and content should be able to be
        accessed. No element behind the modal overlay should be in the tab index or accessible to
        screen readers for as long as the modal is visible. We can achieve this by using a focus
        trap.

      <li>Div has a role of "dialog"</li>

        Div also has aria-labelledby="id" to give an accessible name. It will point to the element

        The title or purpose of the element should contain the "id" that is being referenced by the
