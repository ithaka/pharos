        <li>Do use alerts thoughtfully and sparingly for only the most important information.</li>
        <li>Do keep the messaging concise, scannable, and actionable (if needed).</li>
        <li>
          Do focus messaging on a single topic or required action to avoid overwhelming the user.

      <ul>
        <li>Don't use alerts for marketing information.</li>
        <li>
          Don't use redundant terms. As an example, saying "successfully" in alerts that confirm a
          successful action is redundant.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't include more than one or two links per alert. The primary action should be listed
          first.
        </li>
        <li>Don't use ephemeral messaging to convey important context like form errors.</li>
        <li>Don't display more than one alert at a time.</li>

<PageSection title="Content guidelines">
  <em>Good alert messaging should:</em>
  <ul>
    <li>Be scannable, brief, and to the point.</li>
    <li>Be written in a human-readable language.</li>
    <li>
      Be as specific as possible. A generic statement like, "Something went wrong" doesn't provide
      enough context to help ground the user.
    </li>
    <li>Include constructive advice on how to fix a problem.</li>
    <li>Be no more than one or two sentences.</li>
    <li>
      Be written in <u>Sentence case</u>. Capitalize the first word in the heading and proper nouns
      only.
    </li>
    <li>Use appropriate punctuation. Each message should end in a period.</li>

          Alerts notify assistive technologies of a message that will be audibly read to the users if
          <code>role=alert</code> is put onto an element
          <ul>
            <li>
              Examples (via MDN): invalid form entry, expiring session or loss of connection resulting

          Different ways to use aria-live:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>aria-live="assertive"</code>
              <ul>
                <li>Immediately interrupts the user to read the message</li>
                <li>A use case would be informing the user of an error message</li>

            <li>
              <code>aria-live="polite" </code>

                <li>Waits until the user is idle to deliver the message</li>
                <li>
                  A use case would be informing the user of information that is immediately important
                  so it can wait until they are at a standstill, such as a loading spinner
                </li>

          Putting <code>role="alert"</code> can notify users of a error in a form
          <ul>
            <li>
              This technique is the same as adding <code>aria-live="assertive"</code>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          This element does not need to be able to receive focus as it is read as an audible message,
          unless the alert contains links or any interactable elements
        </li>
        <li>
          If an alert is displayed statically on a page, it does NOT need an "alert" role or live
          region
          <ul>
            <li>
              If the alert opens on a new page, the user needs to be notified of this change audibly
              as well.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          If an alert appears after a user has taken an action, it should be wrapped in
          aria-live-region and have <code>role="alert"</code> and <code>aria-live="assertive"</code>.
          In cases where a user has taken action (like filling out and submitting a form), the user's
          attention is required to remedy the error.

          <li>Error messages should inform the user on how to fix them</li>
