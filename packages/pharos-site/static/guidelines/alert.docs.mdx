  Alerts inform users about important information, which can be displayed as persistent site
  messaging or appear based on a task that a user is trying to complete.
</p>

## Usage

Use alerts if you need to communicate to users in a prominent way to take action or be made aware of important information that does not interrupt their experience.

### Appropriate Placement

- Alerts relevant to an entire page should be placed at the top of that page, below the page header.

<img
  src={workspaceAlert}
  alt="Alert placement example"
  className="pharos-storybook__image"
  width="700"
/>

- Alerts related to a section of a page, like a modal, should be placed inside that section, below any section heading.

<img
  src={errorSection}
  alt="Alert in section example"
  className="pharos-storybook__image"
  width="700"
/>

- Alerts related to an element more specific than a section should be placed immediately above or below that element.

#### Transition

When displaying an alert, push the content below it down (could be the page content below or the section content).

## Best Practices

### Dos

- Do use alerts thoughtfully and sparingly for only the most important information.
- Do keep the messaging concise, scannable, and actionable (if needed).
- Do focus messaging on a single topic or required action to avoid overwhelming the user.

### Don'ts

- Don't use alerts for marketing information.
- Don't use redundant terms. As an example, saying "successfully" in alerts that confirm a successful action is redundant.
- Don't include more than one or two links per alert. The primary action should be listed first.
- Don't use ephemeral messaging to convey important context like form errors.
- Don't display more than one alert at a time.

## Content Guidelines

**Good alert messaging should:**

- Be scannable, brief, and to the point.
- Be written in a human-readable language.
- Be as specific as possible. A generic statement like, "Something went wrong" doesn't provide enough context to help ground the user.
- Include constructive advice on how to fix a problem.
- Be no more than one or two sentences.
- Be written in <u>Sentence case</u>. Capitalize the first word in the heading and proper nouns only.
- Use appropriate punctuation. Each message should end in a period.

## Variants

### Success

Use a success alert when notifying the user that a task has been completed. They can include follow up actions if necessary related to the task.

<Canvas>
  <PharosAlert status="success">
    <p className="alert-example__content">
      Your username and a link to reset your password have been sent to your email address.
    </p>
    <p className="alert-example__content">
      If this email does not arrive within a few minutes,{' '}
      <PharosLink href="#">try entering your password again</PharosLink> or contact{' '}
      <PharosLink href="#">support@jstor.org</PharosLink>
    </p>
  </PharosAlert>
</Canvas>

#### Messaging:

Inform the user of the completion of their task in past tense and what they can expect next.

### Informational

Use an info alert when notifying the user of neutral information. They can include links for users to take action.

<Canvas>
  <PharosAlert status="info">
    This is a temporary workspace and will expire in 2 days. To save and keep your workspace
    forever, <PharosLink href="#">log in</PharosLink> or <PharosLink href="#">register</PharosLink>
  </PharosAlert>
</Canvas>

### Warning

Use a warning alert to inform users of an instance that will directly impact the ability for them to complete their task. It should provide a reason for the warning, a recommended next step, and a way to contact us. Warnings are meant to be less alarming than error alerts.

<Canvas>
  <PharosAlert status="warning">
    The information provided does not match our records. Please check your username or password and
    try again. If the issue persists, please contact{' '}
    <PharosLink href="#">support@jstor.org</PharosLink>.
  </PharosAlert>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <PharosAlert status="warning">
    This email address is connected to JSTOR with a Google account. Please try{' '}
    <PharosLink href="#">logging in with Google</PharosLink> to access your account. If this doesn't
    seem right, contact <PharosLink href="#">support@jstor.org</PharosLink>.
  </PharosAlert>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <PharosAlert status="warning">
    Your session expired. To continue, please <PharosLink href="#">log in</PharosLink>
  </PharosAlert>
</Canvas>

### Error

Use an error alert when the user has submitted something the system can't accept, preventing them from continuing or when there is a system error that needs immediate attention.

<Canvas>
  <PharosAlert status="error">
    We're sorry, we experienced an issue submitting your report. Please try again. If the issue
    persists, contact{' '}
    <PharosLink href="#" onBackground>
      support@jstor.org
    </PharosLink>
  </PharosAlert>
</Canvas>

To provide extra clarity, doubling on the use of Alerts and inline validation helps people quickly notice, find, and remedy errors.

<img
  src={errorAlertDoubled}
  alt="Doubled alert example"
  className="pharos-storybook__image"
  width="700"
/>

#### Messaging:

**If the user made an error** the messaging should provide a reason for the alert, a recommended next step, and a way to contact us. If there are multiple errors, summarize them in a logical order (e.g. for forms that are missing several required fields from the user).

<Canvas>
  <PharosAlert status="error">
    <p className="alert-example__content">
      Please correct the following highlighted fields before continuing.
    </p>
    <ul className="alert-example__content">
      <li>Username</li>
      <li>Password</li>
      <li>Accept JSTOR's Terms and Conditions</li>
    </ul>
  </PharosAlert>
</Canvas>

**If there is a system error** or something went wrong on our end, be apologetic, take the blame, provide a reason for the alert, and a way to contact us.

<Canvas>
  <PharosAlert status="error">
    We're sorry, we experienced an issue submitting your report. Please try again. If the issue
    persists, contact{' '}
    <PharosLink href="#" onBackground>
      support@jstor.org
    </PharosLink>
  </PharosAlert>
</Canvas>

## Accessibility

- Alert notifications should contain `role="alert"` on the container to signal to assistive technology that they require the user's immediate attention.
- If an alert appears after a user has taken an action, it should be wrapped in aria-live-region and have `role="alert"` and `aria-live="assertive"`. In cases where a user has taken action (like filling out and submitting a form), the user's attention is required to remedy the error.
- If an alert is displayed statically on a page, it does NOT need an "alert" role or live region.
