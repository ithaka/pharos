# Textarea

<p
  style={{
    fontSize: 'var(--pharos-type-scale-6)',
    lineHeight: '2rem',
    marginBottom: 'var(--pharos-spacing-5-x)',
  }}
>
  A text area allows users to enter long, free-form text that can be on multiple lines.
</p>

## Usage

Use textareas when you want to allow users to enter a sizeable amount of free-form text, like leaving feedback, adding a description, creating a note and more.

The length of the text input provides a hint to users as to how much text to write. If an input requires users to write longer forms of text use a textarea instead of a single text input field.

## Best Practices

### Dos

- Use when an input needs users to longer amounts of text
- Make sure the label clearly indicates to the user what kind of input is expected of them
- Labels need to describe the purpose of the form control and must be used for all textarea inputs
- Placeholder text should be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data, rather than an explanatory message

### Don'ts

- Do not use placeholder text as a replacement for labels

## Content Guidelines

### Labels

- The textarea label needs to be helpful in telling the user what is expected of them, but they do not need to be instructive
- Labels are placed above the textarea
- Labels are to be written in sentence case and should only be 1-3 words long

### Placeholder Text

Placeholder text is shown inside the textarea to help users know what information they can enter.

- Field placeholder text is used for supplementary information
- The text should be written as examples instead of instructions

## States

### Default

A textarea should be used when the user needs to enter multiple lines of text.

<Canvas>
  <PharosTextarea>
    <span slot="label">Textarea label</span>
  </PharosTextarea>
</Canvas>

### Disabled

A state which indicates that the user should not be able to interact with the input.

<Canvas>
  <PharosTextarea disabled>
    <span slot="label">Textarea label</span>
  </PharosTextarea>
</Canvas>

### Required

Indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the form can be submitted.

<Canvas>
  <PharosTextarea required>
    <span slot="label">Textarea label</span>
  </PharosTextarea>
</Canvas>

### Read-only

A state where the field cannot be edited by the user.

<Canvas>
  <PharosTextarea readonly>
    <span slot="label">Textarea label</span>
  </PharosTextarea>
</Canvas>

### Error

A state that lets the user know there has been an error with what was inputted.

<Canvas>
  <PharosTextarea required invalidated message="This field is required">
    <span slot="label">Textarea label</span>
  </PharosTextarea>
</Canvas>

## Accessibility

- Every textarea must have a label. A textarea without a label is ambiguous and not accessible
- In cases where context is sufficient and a label could be hidden, make sure to have the design reviewed

### Accessibility best practices for labels

- Labels must be visible when an input gets focus
- Labels must be announced to the screen reader on focus
- Use sentence case
- If the text input is a required field include the aria-required property and indicate that it is a required field and use the validation message for input errors.
