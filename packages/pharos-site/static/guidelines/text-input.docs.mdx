<PageSection title="Usage">
  <p>
    Inputs are used for forms or inputting data to get a result, so the design and implementation
    should be as concise as possible. Careful thought should be considered about the need for each
    text input and what value the data will provide. What do we gain by asking the user to provide
    this information?
  </p>

<PageSection title="Best Practices">
  <BestPractices
    Do={
      <ul>
        <li>
          Make sure the label clearly indicates to the user what kind of input is expected of them
        </li>
        <li>
          Labels need to describe the purpose of the form control and must be used for all text
          inputs
        </li>
        <li>
          Placeholder text should be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of
          data, rather than an explanatory message
        </li>
      </ul>
    }
    Dont={
      <ul>
        <li>Do not use when users are choosing from a specific set of options</li>
        <li>Do not use placeholder text as a replacement for labels</li>
      </ul>
    }

<PageSection title="Content Guidelines">
  <PageSection subSectionLevel={1} title="Labels">
    <ul>
      <li>
        The input label needs to be helpful in telling the user what is expected of them, but they
        do not need to be instructive
      </li>
      <li>Labels are placed above the input text field</li>
      <li>Labels are to be written in sentence case and should only be 1-3 words long</li>
    </ul>
  </PageSection>
  <PageSection subSectionLevel={1} title="Placeholder Text">
    <p>
      Placeholder text is shown inside the text input to help users know what information they can
      enter.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Field placeholder text is used for supplementary information</li>
      <li>The text should be written as examples instead of instructions</li>
    </ul>
  </PageSection>
</PageSection>

<PageSection title="Variants">
  <PageSection subSectionLevel={1} title="Text">
    <p>
      The text variant should be used when the user needs to enter a single-line value and there
      isn't a more specific input type available for collecting that value.
    </p>
  </PageSection>
  <PageSection subSectionLevel={1} title="Password">
    <p>
      A password input is a single-line text field whose value is obscured. Use it when you need to
      protect the user's content from being read.
    </p>
  </PageSection>
  <PageSection subSectionLevel={1} title="Email">
    <p>
      A search input allows the user to enter search queries. Line-breaks are automatically removed
      from the input value. They may include a delete or "clear" icon in supporting browsers that
      can be used to clear the field.
    </p>
  </PageSection>
  <PageSection subSectionLevel={1} title="Search">
    <p>
      Use the email variant to allow the user to enter or edit an email address. You get automatic
      validation that the entered text is in the correct form to potentially be a legitimate e-mail
      address. This can help avoid cases in which the user mistypes or enters an invalid address.
    </p>
  </PageSection>
  <PageSection subSectionLevel={1} title="Number">
    <p>
      This is used for entering a number. It displays a numeric keypad in some devices with dynamic
      keypads. Usually a set of up and down buttons are also provided to step the value up and down.
    </p>
  </PageSection>
  <PageSection subSectionLevel={1} title="URL">
    <p>
      The URL input allows users to input a valid URL. Using this type, you get automatic validation
      that the entered text is at least in the correct form to potentially be a legitimate URL. This
      can help avoid cases in which the user mistypes the website's address, or provides an invalid
      one.
    </p>
  </PageSection>
  <PageSection subSectionLevel={1} title="Hidden">
    <p>
      A hidden input does not display a value to the user, but its value is submitted to the server.
      This is used when you want to include data the user doesn't need to see or edit along with the
      form when it's submitted to the server, such as a unique security token.
    </p>
  </PageSection>
  <PageSection subSectionLevel={1} title="Tel">
    <p>
      The tel input allows the user to enter or edit a telephone number. They display a telephone
      keypad in some devices with dynamic keypads. The input value is not automatically validated to
      a particular format because they vary so much around the world.

<PageSection title="Accessibility">
  <ul>
    <li>
      Every text input must have a label. A text input without a label is ambiguous and not
      accessible
    </li>
    <li>
      In cases where context is sufficient and a label could be hidden, make sure to have the design
      reviewed
    </li>
  </ul>
  <PageSection subSectionLevel={1} title="Accessibility best practices for labels">
    <ul>
      <li>Labels must be visible when an input gets focus</li>
      <li>Labels must be announced to the screen reader on focus</li>
      <li>Use sentence case</li>
      <li>
        If the text input is a required field include the aria-required property and indicate that
        it is a required field and use the validation message for input errors.
