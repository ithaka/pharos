The following sections describe how we handle branches and commit messages.

## Branches

### Branching strategy

Because `@ithaka/pharos` is an installable package rather than a runtime application, it can't be verified in production the same way applications are. Pharos may need to support multiple teams at various stages of being up-to-date, too, so the branching strategy is:

1. A core `develop` branch representing the latest work
1. A `main` branch for releasing stable versions
1. Short-lived development branches off of `develop`
1. Long-lived release family branches as needed

### Branch naming

The Pharos branching strategy resembles [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow), and the branch names correspond fairly closely. Name your branches using the following format:

```
<branch type>/<summary>
```

Where `<branch type>` is typically one of:

- `feature`: A new component, new capability of a component, and so on
- `bugfix`: Fixing the intended functionality or display of a component
- `docs`: Adding documentation for a component, process, and so on
- `hotfix`: A quick bugfix to address something recently merged

#### Examples

- `bugfix/focus-toasts`
- `feature/radio-button`
- `hotfix/missing-alt-attrs`
- `docs/code-review-process`

Other types may make sense too, so this isn't a hard-and-fast rule:

- `maintenance/extract-slack-notifier-in-jenkinsfile`
- `experiment/try-using-latest-litelement`
- `brand/add-color-guidelines`

## Commits

### Commit messages

Commits must follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to create a coherent commit history and help communicate intent to Pharos consumers. The commit message convention is structured as follows:

```
type(scope?): description

[body?]

[footer(s)?]
```

The **type** of the commit describes the nature of the work you're committing. You can choose one of the following values:

- `build`
- `chore`
- `ci`
- `docs`
- `feat`
- `fix`
- `perf`
- `refactor`
- `revert`
- `style`
- `test`

The **scope** represents the area to which your change pertains, such as a component. The **description** of your message should be a brief statement using imperative tense describing the work you did.

Imagine you fixed a bug in the Button component. Your commit would look something like the following:

```
fix(button): remove platform-native styling
```

If a change needs context, consider adding a full commit body which includes those details rather than saving it for a pull request:

```
fix(text-input): set focus on input element

When focusing on a <pharos-text-input>, focus was
initially falling on the text label rather than the
input itself. This was due to the way the focus API
works in IE11.
```

You can do this readily in most IDEs. If you're using Git from the command line, you can also either exclude the `-m` flag, which will open your editor to author the commit message, or by specifying `-m` twiceâ€”the first for the summary and the second for the body.

If your commit includes breaking changes, be sure to include a footer in your message starting with `BREAKING CHANGE:` followed by details on the change:

```
refactor(tokens): rename color design tokens

BREAKING CHANGE: remove the word `brand` from color tokens
```

### Pre-commit hooks

Pharos uses the [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) package to enforce pre-commit hooks. The pre-commit hooks in Pharos use [Prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier), [eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint), and [stylelint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint) to check and format the code in changed files. It also uses [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) to ensure commit messages follow the conventional commit format.

If your commit fails, check the output and make updates to correct any issues. Committing a second time should be successful if you've resolved all outstanding issues.
